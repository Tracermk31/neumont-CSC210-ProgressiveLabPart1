            After college my dream goal is to get a job at Nintendo. Their work culture and environment I have heard is absolutely top notch. Beyond the fact that they have made some of
            my favorite games of all time, their desire to always innovate (for better and for worse) and push the boundaries of what is possible is an inspiration. They have pioneered almost
            every major development in gaming history after the invention of the home console. The SNES gamepad, 3D gaming, Motion controls, Handheld gaming, Portable console gaming. All things
            initiated by Nintendo and then followed up by their competitors. Nintendo has the most well known individuals in gaming, with Shigeru Miyamoto, the late Satoru Iwata, Masahiro Sakurai.
            I want to be one of those innovators.

            As backup plans in the very likely situation that I can't immediately get a job there, I hope to work somewhere similar such as at Larian Studios or Owlcat Games, both companies 
            that push the boundaires in their respective genres and are always looking to do the next great thing. If for whatever reason that falls through and I can't even find a job in 
            game development, I can still work my degree and experience in life to get a job in a software development field. If somehow that also falls through, my experience as a Marine and
            my degree would allow me to comission into the Military as an officer, which while undesirable at this stage in my life, would be a stable and relatively easy task to accomplish.
            If that somehow is impossible for me, I also have experience that would allow me to work as a law enforcement agent, whether that be a street cop, or something more federal at a 
            3 letter agency.
