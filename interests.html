            Since I was a small child I have always been interested in gaming. My first game was Halo when I was 3 years old, but I very quickly found the Legend of Zelda and fell in love with that.
            My favorite types of games are those that make you think and provide the player agency in how the game unfolds. As a child I would play Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II for 
            thousands of hours in total. I preferred the second game over the first as the second game I felt had a more nuances and interesting take on the world of Star Wars, where as the first
            was more of a straightforward story. I of course enjoy tons of different games, such as ARMA, the FromSoftware catalogue of games, Animal Crossing, Mario, and many many more. I do not
            discriminate between genres as long as the game at its core is well made and enjoyable. I do have a preference for those playerdriven games, however.

            I think one of the greatest failures of modern gaming is treating games like a book or a movie with a set story. The player is the most defining part of a vidoe game, and to exclude 
            them from the decisions in the game is a huge mistake in my opinion. For that reason my favorite genre is CRPGs and similar games such as the older Fallout Games,  the Baldurs Gate 
            games, the modern Pathfinder Games by Owlcat Games, even games like Breath of the Wild and Disco Elysium. These games all hold the player as king. The player could decided to kill
            all the npcs they come across in Fallout, and the game accounts for that. The Pathfinder Games allow for dozens of unique playthroughs, especially Wrath of the Righteous
            with different quests and events depending on the decisions the player has made throughout the game. Breath of the Wild gives the player the freedom to attack the final boss at the
            beginning of the game should they desire. Is this a smart choice for the player? Absolutely not, but the importance is that the choice is there, and it is up to the player to understand
            that it is in their best interest to do other parts of the game first.
