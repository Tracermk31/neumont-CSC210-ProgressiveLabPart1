        <h2>Favorite Sites</h2>
        <p>
            The requirements dictate that there needs to be at least two paragraphs of text here. I have absolutely no clue what I'm supposed to write about my 'favorite' websites. The only 
            website here I would consider a favorite is youtube as I use that everyday. The others are just filler websites or websites I use every now and then that I put in for the sake of 
            meeting the requirements. So if you are interested in the same websites that I'm sure most other people in this course use, here you go. If not, well congratulation I have now
            introuduced you to some of the most well known websites in the world. You're welcome C=.

           Now for Paragraph Two I will discuss the absurdity that is the Youtube ad policy. I, as most other users I'm sure, use Ad block on my browsers as I am absolutely not going to wait
           for a 1-5 minute ad to play so I can watch a quick video on how to cook a chicken. The issue now arises that Youtubes response to this is to attempt to punish those who use adblockers
           by not allowing them to actually watch Youtube videos, and to punish those who don't use adblockers by forcing even more ads onto them to make up the difference. This of course, only works
           because there has yet to be any true competition to Youtube in terms of video sharing and audience. The most effective solution would be for a competitor to provide a platform of similar
           quality, which will be difficult as Youtube has decades of QA experience at this point, and at a smaller cost, which would also be difficult as servers are costly and require individuals to
           maintain them. Truly an unfortunate situation. That is my second paragraph of text.
