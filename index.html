        <h2><i>Personal Biography</i></h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Puerto Rico July 31st, 1998. I moved and grew up all over the USA due to being part of a military family which disallowed me from making long term friends. I was 
            always interested in gaming, and would spend almost all my free time doing that, usually at a detriment to my grades. I was also interested in the United States Military, due to 
            my family being in the Army, although my time in High School would expose me to the Unites States Marine Corps through the JROTC program. After graduating highschool in 2016, I 
            tried out college but found the experience very monotonous and unenjoyable. Not feeling good in my current position, I left college, and with a desire to better myself I 
            enlisted into the <b>United States Marine Corps</b> and started a new chapter in my life.

            As a Marine, I went through training and came out at the end of it all a Marine whose job it was to repair satellite communication equipment. I got to spend the next 3 years in Japan
            working over there, being exposed to Japanese Culture, and bettering myself physically and mentally. During my time in Japan, I heard of a program called the Marine Security Guard 
            program that called for Marines interested in serving as security guards in embassies overseas. Wanting to take advantage of this program, I signed up, was approving for training,
            and after months of trainning, graduated and was sent to Embassies in Cameroun, Romania, and Peru. Throughout my time there, I learned alot about many different cultures outside of 
            the US, practiced the diplomatic tact necessary to understand and communicate differing ideas without insulting the other side, and more importantly met my wife. After my time was
            through in the Program, I decided that I had gained everything I wanted from the Marine Corps, and left to go study at Neumont University where I am now writing this biography to
            pass a class.
